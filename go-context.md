## Context Package
- Context is immutable
- The Context package provides functions to add new behavior.
- To add cancellation behavior we have functions like:
    - `context.WithCancel()`
    - `context.WithTimeout()`
    - `context.WithDeadline()`
- The derived context is passed to the children goroutines to facilitate their cancellation.
---

## Example Go Code using context
- `WithCancel()` Example:
    - Creates a context that is cancellable
    - `ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())`
    - `defer cancel()`
    - `WithCancel` returns a copy of the parent context with a new 'Done' channel.
    - `cancel()` can be used to close the context's done channel.
    - Closing the done channel indicates to an operation to abandon its work and return.
    - Canceling the context releases the resources associated with it.
    - It's very important that we call the cancel function as soon as the operation running the context is complete.
    - If we don't, there will be a memory leak.
    - The resources that are associated with the context won't be released until the current context is cancelled or the parent context is cancelled.
    - `cancel()` does not wait for the work to stop.
    - `cancel()` may be called by multiple goroutines simultaneously.
    - After the first call, the subsequent calls to `cancel()` do nothing.
    - Full Example:
      - `ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context,Background())`
      - `ch := generator(ctx)`
      - `if n == 5 {`
      -   `cancel()`
      - `}` - This is the parent Goroutine
      - `for {`
      -   `select {`
      -   `case <-ctx.Done():`
      -    `return ctx.Err()`
      -    ` dst <- n:`
      -    `n++`
      -    `}`
      -   `}` - This is the child Goroutine
